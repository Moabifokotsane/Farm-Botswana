		<h2>Soil Quality</h2>
		<p>Understanding soil quality is crucial for successful farming. This section provides information on the different soil types in Botswana and how to improve soil health for different crops.</p>
		
		<div class="card">
			<h3>Kalahari Sands</h3>
			<p>This soil type is commonly found in the central and western parts of Botswana, especially in the Kalahari Desert region.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="card">
			<h3>Leached Sands</h3>
			<p>These soils are found in the eastern parts of Botswana, which receive higher rainfall than the western parts. They are particularly common in the Selebi-Phikwe area.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="card">
			<h3>Clay Soils</h3>
			<p>These soils are found in areas with higher rainfall, such as the eastern and northern parts of Botswana. They are particularly common in the Okavango Delta region.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="card">
			<h3>Loamy Soils</h3>
			<p>These soils are found in areas with moderate rainfall, such as the central and eastern parts of Botswana. They are particularly common in the Palapye area.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="card">
			<h3>Sandy Soils</h3>
			<p>These soils are found in the arid and semi-arid regions of Botswana, which cover much of the western and southern parts of the country.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="card">
			<h3>Basalt Soils</h3>
			<p>These soils are commonly found in the northeastern parts of Botswana, particularly in the Francistown and Tutume areas.</p>

  <h2>Planting and Harvesting Best Practices</h2>
  <p>Botswana is a major producer of crops such as maize, sorghum, beans, and groundnuts. Follow these best practices to ensure successful planting and harvesting:</p>
  <div class="card-container">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Planting</h3>
      <p>Plant seeds at the beginning of the rainy season to ensure adequate moisture for germination. Use high-quality seeds and plant at the correct depth for each crop. Fertilize according to soil test results and use appropriate pest control measures.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Watering</h3>
      <p>Irrigate crops during dry periods or when there is not enough rain. Use efficient irrigation techniques such as drip irrigation to conserve water.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Harvesting</h3>
      <p>Harvest crops when they are fully mature, but before they become overripe. Use sharp tools and handle the crops carefully to avoid damage. Store harvested crops in a cool, dry place to prevent spoilage.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Crop Rotation</h3>
      <p>Rotate crops to help improve soil health and prevent the build-up of pests and diseases. For example, rotate maize with legumes such as beans or groundnuts to fix nitrogen in the soil and reduce the need for fertilizer.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Crop Diversity</h3>
      <p>Plant a variety of crops to spread risk and improve resilience to climate variability. Consider planting drought-tolerant crops such as sorghum and millet, which require less water than maize.</p>
